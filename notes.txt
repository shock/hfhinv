Devise setup instructions: https://github.com/plataformatec/devise#getting-started


DONE:

* Deploy to Heroku (https://hfhinv.herokuapp.com), works
* Use Item description on Item show page title, when available
* Add flow from Donor entry, to Donation entry, to add multiple Items for a donation/pickup
* Scope items by ItemType and Department
* Add a "General Stock" UseOfItem type to database seeds.
* For items whose ItemType has no code, do not automatically create an inventory number
* Use select2 for item_type dropdown in new Item so users can start typing the type and filter selections
* Show # of donations for Donors index; sortable.
* Update Donations show Title to something more descriptive
    https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/184
* include item_types and departments on Items index load for filter collections
* include description in Items filter
* Don't let admin delete Departments or ItemTypes if they have associated items
* Create "Other" ItemType for all Departments, and have required freeform fields for type name and code, as well as optional notes prompt
* Add "View on Map" for Donors and Donations.  Simply opens address Google maps in a separate tab for now.
* Set place-holder text for item description based on selected ItemType notes
* Get official HFH colors from Zakk's texts and google for the official HFH branding guide (Zakk sent official PDF)
* Update styling based on HFH branding guide; still want Zakk's feedback on this.
* Re-skin the app, using official colors.  Allow admin to change them?  Probably not.
* Add CCHFH logo to Dashboard
* Modify Item form and move UseOfItem field up
* Create ZipCode model, so we can associate zipcodes/towns with delivery/pickup days of the week
* Create SystemState model
* Create function to export Inventory Items for import into QuickBooks (MVP)
* Bug when selecting/Other type, and creating a new Item (look at heroky logs)

TODO:
* Seed the database with 'Misc' Item Types for some categories (Zakk curates).  Next, more importantly:
* Change the description for "Other" in Department item type to "Create New" (because we'll have the Misc category for truly miscellaneous stuff)
* Show dotw on donations under Donor show panel
* Museum of Osteology
* Create function to import QuickBooks inventory and update date_sold, and sale_price (MVP)
* Noble is all one zip code: 73068 (says Zakk)
* Moore has two zips: 73160, 73170
* We need to reset the starting sequential item ID before production (the integer that gets sent to QB) when we switch over, so the ID numbers do not overlap.  During beta, we may need to let the user enter the ID manually, to match the generated ID from the Excel Inventory spreadsheet.  I'm not sure if this is MVP.  If we can *guarantee* uniqueness of the "inventory number", the item ID will be redundant, but it would optimize database lookups.

* Admin can generate printable/exportable reports (see notes from discussions with Zakk/Mike)
* Auto-email receipts to customer if they opted in for it, when all items are entered.

* Export a Pickup Manifest for a given date, (perhaps as HTML), and allow printing clean format from browser
* Add a general received flag for donations. (sometimes truck has to make multiple trips per day, so optimizing for a single route may not always work)

* when listing items for a donation that has been picked_up, highlight items that have not be marked as received
* Use geokit gem to geocode donor addresses and determine optimal routes

  OR
  https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper
* Model deliveries in the system, and include them on the truck driver's per-day manifest, including optimal routing like pickups.
* Once UseOfItem is set, auto-set the received_date to Today if it's null.
* create cchfh.yml file for and use for seeds and zipcode -> dotw pickup/delivery mappings
* Try to get better date-time picker for pickup dates
    https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/wiki/combine-datetime-picker-with-activeadmin
* Map subdomains on cchfh.org to heroku's domains. eg. inventory.cchfh.org maps to production heroku domain
* Make this mofo the POS, instead of QB.  Numerous benefits!  Would need a card reader like Square for CC/debit cards.
